UTR Analysis Pipeline Test Dataset
==================================

## Overview

The purpose of this test dataset is to capture all possible scenarios for
which we might expect to find spliced leader (SL) sequences and Poly(A) tails
in RNA-Seq reads, and to differentiate those from similar, but non-real (false
positive) scenarios.

Using this test dataset, we can ensure that the pipeline is properly detecting
and characterizing all "true" SL/Poly(A) hits, and also ensure that it is
ignoring genomic sequences that _appear_ to be SL or Poly(A) derrived, but are
not.

Moreover, since different file formats and programming languages use different
coordinate systems (0- or 1-indexed), having a set of known sites with manually
determined coordinates helps to ensure that the code does not suffer from
off-by-one errors when reporting locations of SL and Poly(A) sites.

Each of the reads included comes from a real _T. cruzi_ Y strain RNA-Seq
sample. For speed and simplicity, we have restricted ourselves to the first
two chromosomes of *T. cruzi*.

The FASTQ file included here contains one read for each of the following
scenarios:

## Spliced leader

### Positive strand

- Portion of the SL at the start of read 
    1. HWI-1KL118:75:C267FACXX:4:1311:21375:97418 (R1, TcCLB.506717.130)
    2. HWI-1KL118:75:C267FACXX:4:2311:5511:72243 (R2, TcCLB.506717.219)
- Portion of the SL in the middle of the read, with artifactual (non-genomic)
   sequence upstream of it.
    3. HWI-1KL118:75:C267FACXX:4:2102:3429:91194 (R1, TcCLB.506533.106)
    4. HWI-1KL118:75:C267FACXX:4:2313:2265:3900 (R1, TcCLB.506533.106)
- Portion of the SL in a read, with a smaller genomic (non-real) hit in the
   middle of the read.
- Reverse complement of the above scenarios.

### Negative strand

- Portion of the SL at the start of read 
    - HWI-1KL118:75:C267FACXX:4:1315:20505:74568 (R1, TcCLB.507941.160)
    - HWI-1KL118:75:C267FACXX:4:1113:3259:52771 (R2, TcCLB.510351.50)
- Portion of the SL in the middle of the read, with artifactual (non-genomic)
   sequence upstream of it.
    - HWI-1KL118:75:C267FACXX:4:1113:11382:45693 (R1, TcCLB.507941.80)
    - HWI-1KL118:75:C267FACXX:4:1301:12715:37541 (R2, TcCLB.507941.40)
- Portion of the SL in a read, with a smaller genomic (non-real) hit in the
   middle of the read.
- Reverse complement of the above scenarios.

## Generation of test data

Test data was generated by extracting actual reads matching each of the
scenarios of interest from a collection of *T. cruzi* RNA-Seq samples.

In order to keep the test data as simple as possible, reads were limited
to a single sample (HPGL0254)
